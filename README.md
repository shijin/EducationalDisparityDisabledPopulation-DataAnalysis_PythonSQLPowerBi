# Disability and Education in India (Census 2011) - Data Analysis Project

## Overview

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- SQL (for structured querying â€“ optional)
- R (for statistical testing and validation)
- Power BI (planned dashboard visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Objectives
